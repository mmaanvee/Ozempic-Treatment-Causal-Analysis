# Ozempic-Treatment-Causal-Analysis
Developed Python ML pipeline to analyze Ozempic's impact on patient improvement, including detailed EDA, feature engineering, and preprocessing of complex medical datasets. Applied advanced causal inference techniques like double-lasso for feature selection, validated achieving higher accuracy. 


## Key Features:
Detailed EDA: Conducted in-depth exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the underlying patterns and distributions within the medical datasets.

## Feature Engineering: 
Employed feature engineering techniques to extract relevant information from the data, enhancing the predictive power of the machine learning models.

## Preprocessing of Complex Medical Datasets
Implemented robust preprocessing methodologies to handle the complexities inherent in medical datasets, ensuring data integrity and model reliability.

## Advanced Causal Inference Techniques
Applied causal inference techniques, such as double-lasso for feature selection, to identify the most influential factors impacting patient improvement. The double lasso treatment was specifically employed to reduce endogeneity, ensuring the robustness of the causal analysis.


## Dataset Analysis Insights and Results: 

Within the dataset, there's an overrepresentation of individuals residing in affluent regions, particularly in California, where the influence of Hollywood on body images and the prevalence of wealthy neighborhoods may impact the availability and utilization of Ozempic. This demographic might be utilizing Ozempic for reasons unrelated to its intended purpose, such as weight loss, rather than specifically for treating conditions like hypertension or obesity. Consequently, this introduces the challenge of selection bias and affects the accuracy of our analysis regarding the true impact of Ozempic.

Moreover, the lack of clarity regarding whether individuals are using the medication for its intended purpose or for its secondary effects further contributes to an ill-defined treatment group, complicating the interpretation of results and conclusions drawn from the analysis.

To address these concerns and gain a clearer understanding of the true impact of Ozempic, stratifying the treatment group based on geographical location could offer valuable insights. By examining outcomes within different demographic segments, we can better assess the effectiveness of Ozempic in treating specific health conditions and mitigate the influence of extraneous factors such as socioeconomic status and cultural influences.
